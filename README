xf86-video-omap
Open-source X.org graphics driver for TI OMAP graphics

Currently relies on a closed-source submodule for EXA acceleration on
the following chipsets:
  + OMAP3430
  + OMAP3630
  + OMAP4430
  + OMAP4460
  + OMAP5430
  + OMAP5432


NOTE: this driver is work in progress..  you probably don't want to try
and use it yet.  The API/ABI between driver and kernel, and driver and
acceleration submodules is not stable yet.  This driver requires the
omapdrm kernel driver w/ GEM support.

EXA vs UXA?  This is an open question..
